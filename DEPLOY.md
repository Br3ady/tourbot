## 🎯 **My Recommendation: Railway**

For your use case, I'd go with **Railway** because:

1. **5-minute setup** - literally just connect GitHub and click deploy
2. **Free tier** gives you plenty of usage to start
3. **Automatic deployments** - every time you push to GitHub, it updates
4. **Built-in environment variables** - secure API key storage
5. **Custom domain** support when you're ready

## 📋 Quick Railway Setup Steps:

1. Push your code to GitHub (if not already there)
2. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) → Sign up with GitHub
3. "Deploy from GitHub repo" → Select this repository
4. Add Environment Variable: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` = `your-claude-api-key`
5. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment
6. **Done!** You'll get a URL like `https://your-app-name.railway.app`

## 🔗 Share Your App

Once deployed, anyone can use your Claude chat by just visiting the URL - no installation, no Python setup, no technical knowledge required!

## 💡 Pro Tips:

- **Custom Domain**: Most platforms let you add a custom domain like `chat.yourname.com`
- **Usage Monitoring**: Keep an eye on your Claude API usage to avoid unexpected bills
- **Updates**: Any changes you make and push to GitHub will auto-deploy
- **Analytics**: Add Google Analytics to track usage if desired

Your app is now ready for the world! 🌍

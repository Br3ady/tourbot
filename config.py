## History

Harvard University was founded in 1636 by the Massachusetts Bay Colony, making it the oldest institution of higher education in the United States. Originally established to train Puritan ministers, the college was named after John Harvard, a young minister who died in 1638 and bequeathed his library of 400 books and half his estate to the institution.

The university's charter was granted by the Great and General Court of Massachusetts Bay Colony. The first building, now known as Old College, was completed in 1642. Harvard's first president was Henry Dunster, who served from 1640 to 1654 and established the college's academic structure.

During the colonial period, Harvard trained most New England clergy. The curriculum focused on classical languages, philosophy, and theology. The college gradually secularized during the 18th century under presidents like John Leverett and Edward Holyoke.

Charles William Eliot served as president from 1869 to 1909, transforming Harvard from a small college into a modern research university. He introduced the elective system, established graduate schools, and recruited distinguished faculty. Under Eliot, Harvard Medical School, Harvard Law School, and other professional schools were founded or significantly expanded.

Harvard's endowment grew substantially in the 20th century through major donations from families like the Wideners, who funded the main library, and other wealthy benefactors. The university expanded physically and academically, adding schools of business, public health, education, and other disciplines.
